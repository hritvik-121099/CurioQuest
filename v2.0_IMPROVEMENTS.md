## 1. ✅ Back Button on Result Screens

**What Changed:**
- Added two buttons to the result popup: "Back to Main Menu" and "Next Quiz"
- Users can now manually choose when to leave the result screen
- Auto-redirect still works (5 seconds for correct answers, 3 seconds for wrong answers)

**Code Changes:**
- **HTML** (`index.html`): Added `<div class="result-actions">` with `nextQuizBtn` and `backToMainBtn` buttons
- **CSS** (`styles.css`): Added `.result-actions` styling for flex layout and button styling
- **JavaScript** (`script.js`): 
  - Modified `showResult()` function to support manual navigation
  - Added `closeResultAndGoToMenu()` function
  - Added event listeners for both buttons

**Where to Find It:**
- User can click "Back to Main Menu" button to instantly return
- Or wait for auto-redirect countdown

## 2. ✅ Section Completion Overlays with Countdown Timer

**What Changed:**
- When all 3 difficulty modes (Beginner, Pro, Expert) are completed in a section, an overlay appears
- Shows "✅ All Modes Done" with a countdown timer until 12 AM reset
- Timer updates every second automatically
- Overlay automatically disappears at midnight (daily reset)

**Code Changes:**
- **CSS** (`styles.css`):
  - Added `.section-completed` class (60% opacity on section card)
  - Added `.section-overlay` class (dark overlay that covers the card)
  - Added `.reset-timer` class (styled badge showing remaining time)

- **JavaScript** (`script.js`):
  - Added `updateCompletedSections()` function
  - Checks if all 3 modes played today
  - Calculates time until midnight (12 AM)
  - Updates timer every second
  - Automatically refreshes on daily reset

**Where to Find It:**
- Main menu → Complete all 3 difficulty modes in any section
- Overlay appears on that section card
- Countdown shows: "Reset in Xh Ym Zs"

## 3. ✅ Real OTP System

**What Changed:**
- Replaced hardcoded "123456" OTP with dynamically generated 6-digit codes
- Each login generates a new random OTP
- System simulates sending OTP via email or mobile (for demo purposes)
- Ready for integration with real SMS/Email services

**Code Changes:**
- **JavaScript** (`script.js`):
  - Added global variable: `let generatedOTP = null`
  - Added `generateOTP()` function → Returns random 6-digit number (100000-999999)
  - Added `sendOTP(email, mobile)` function → Generates OTP and shows alert
  - Modified `handleLogin()` function → Calls `generateOTP()` and `sendOTP()`

**How It Works:**
```javascript
// Example: User enters email
1. User provides email/mobile
2. System generates: "456789" (random 6-digit)
3. Alert shows: "OTP sent to user@example.com\nOTP: 456789"
4. User enters OTP on verification screen
5. System validates and logs user in
```

**Where to Find It:**
- Authentication page → Sign up with email/mobile
- Login page → Enter identifier → Alert with OTP → Verify OTP
